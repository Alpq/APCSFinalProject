PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Hidden in Plain Sight is a competitive multiplayer game played between two people. The game designates one player as the seeker, who must use the mouse to click on the avatar of the hider. The hider uses the keyboard directional keys to blend in with the rest of the NPC avatars. The seeker’s power-ups are cooldown-controlled whereas the hider must walk to their powerups on the map of the game. If the seeker can find the player before time runs out, they win and vice versa. To make the game more interesting, both players have power-ups that make the other’s job more difficult. The game can be played in one-off rounds or longer form games where players play both roles and the winner is chosen based on their overall performance.
